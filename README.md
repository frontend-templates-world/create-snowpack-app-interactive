### Android (Still experimental)

If you want to use the Android part:

 1. Download command line tools from the [official Android download page](https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads)
 2. Create a directory ``$root/Android/cmdline-tools/latest`` at the root of your disk (e.g for Windows ``C:/``)
 3. Drop the downloaded tools inside the created folder.
    * If Windows, add ``$root/Android/cmdline-tools/latest/bin`` to your PATH variable
    * If Linux (or Mac I guess) run ``export PATH="$root/Android/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$PATH"`` in your terminal
 4. You can continue to follow instructions [here](https://guides.codepath.com/android/installing-android-sdk-tools#:~:text=%2F-,Installing%20the%20Android%20SDK%20(Manual%20Way),for%20your%20build%20machine%20OS.).

## Usage

Simply run ``create-snowpack-app-interactive`` (or ``csai``) to start the skeleton. You can define directly the name of your project by using ``create-snowpack-app-interactive your-project``.

## Buy me a ko-fi

Whether you use this project, have learned something from it, or just like it, please consider supporting it by buying me a coffee, so I can dedicate more time on open-source projects like this ðŸ˜‰ (personally I prefer hot chocolate but whatever)
